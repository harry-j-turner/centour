        "content": "Much modified hillfort at Winterbourne Down, South Gloucestershire.\nThe fort today is generally a round cornered rectangle in shape, on an approximately north/south axis. The long western side of the fort is along a steep hill edge above the river Frome, which flows from the cotswold edge near Chipping Sodbury into Bristol. The other three sides are generally on fairly flat land.\nA large proportion of the western side has been destroyed by quarrying into the hillside. The remaining 3 sides are made up of a central ditch, with ramparts built on both the inner and outer sides of the ditch, with strangely the outer rampart generally the higher.\nIt is thought that the Romans took over this fort, and modified it to suit their needs, which perhaps explains the slightly odd ditch and rampart arrangement.",
