        "content": "Much modified hillfort at Winterbourne Down, South Gloucestershire. The fort today is generally a round cornered rectangle in shape, on an approximately north/south axis. The long western side of the fort is along a steep hill edge above the river Frome, which flows from the cotswold edge near Chipping Sodbury into Bristol. The other three sides are generally on fairly flat land. A large proportion of the western side has been destroyed by quarrying into the hillside. The remaining 3 sides are made up of a central ditch, with ramparts built on both the inner and outer sides of the ditch, with strangely the outer rampart generally the higher. It is thought that the Romans took over this fort, and modified it to suit their needs, which perhaps explains the slightly odd ditch and rampart arrangement.",

        "content": "Ram Hill Colliery was sunk sometime between 1820 and 1830. It was owned by the Coalpit Heath Company, which included Sir John Smyth as a shareholder. Sir John was one of the main proponents of the Bristol and Gloucestershire Railway, which linked the pit and others in the area to Cuckolds Pill in Bristol.[1] At this date workable coal was dependent on a means of transport to market, so that the railway and the pit were interdependent.",
